<b><i>PL-300 Solutions</i></b>
</h1>

This repository contains my solutions for [Microsoft Learn's Power BI Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/pl-300) as well as some questions found in the exam that you might use as a resource.
Nevertheless, the answers of said questions aren't always correct, thus you might use it only as a resource and not follow them blindly.
